This document outlines my learning from the **Networking Fundamentals** module, part of my cybersecurity training journey. Below is a breakdown of what each task taught me and how it helped me build a strong foundation in networking concepts.



## Task 1: What is Networking?

In this task, I learned that **networking** is the practice of connecting computers and devices to share resources like files, internet access, and printers. Networks can be as small as a few devices in a room (LAN) or as large as the internet. I now understand that networking is the backbone of communication in both personal and enterprise environments â€” itâ€™s what allows the digital world to interact.



## Task 2: What is the Internet?

This task helped me grasp how the **Internet** is essentially a network of networks. I learned how data travels across the internet using protocols like **TCP/IP**, how **routers** and **DNS** play a role in routing information, and how **ISPs** provide access. It helped me see the internet as a structure built on many layers, each responsible for part of the journey data takes to reach its destination.



## Task 3: Identifying Devices on a Network

Here I explored how to discover devices on a network using commands like `ipconfig`, `ifconfig`, `ping`, and `arp`. I learned how every device on a network has an **IP address** and a **MAC address**, and how tools can help me enumerate or map those devices. This knowledge is crucial for auditing and securing networks, as well as for penetration testing and basic troubleshooting.



## Task 4: Ping (ICMP)

In this task, I learned how to use the `ping` command to check if a device is reachable over a network. It works by sending **ICMP echo requests** and waiting for responses. This simple but powerful tool helps diagnose network issues, check host availability, and validate connectivity. I now understand how ICMP plays a role in **network troubleshooting** and how attackers might also use it in recon.



## Task 5: Continue Your Learning - Intro to LAN

This section introduced me to **Local Area Networks (LANs)**. I learned how LANs function within a limited space (like homes or offices), how they use **switches and routers**, and how devices within a LAN communicate directly. I also saw the difference between **LANs and WANs**, and why LANs are faster and more secure (since they don't pass through the public internet by default).



# Key Takeaways from This Module

- I can now define the Internet and distinguish between public and private networks.
- I understand basic network commands for device discovery and troubleshooting.
- I know the difference between LAN, WAN, and how devices talk over different types of networks.
- Iâ€™ve gained the foundational knowledge needed to begin exploring ethical hacking, packet sniffing, port scanning, and network enumeration.



## Why This Matters

Understanding networking is **crucial** for anyone in cybersecurity or IT. Nearly every security concept â€” from scanning to exploiting and defending â€” depends on knowing how data moves, how devices communicate, and what protocols are involved. This module was the first step in building that deep understanding.

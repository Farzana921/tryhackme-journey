## Task Summaries and Flags i Found

## Task 1: Introduction to Python  
I learned the basics of Python, including variables, loops, functions, data structures, if statements, and file handling. I understood that syntax is crucial in programming to tell the computer how to read code.



## Task 2: Hello World  
I practiced printing output with `print()`. Comments (`#`) are used to explain code but are ignored by the computer.  
**Flag found:** `THM{PRINT_STATEMENTS}`



## Task 3: Mathematical Operators  
I learned how to use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation. Also, comparison operators help evaluate conditions.  
**Flags found:**  
- `THM{ADDITI0N}`  
- `THM{SUBTRCT}`  
- `THM{MULTIPLICATION_PYTHON}`  
- `THM{EXP0N3NT_POWER}`


## Task 4: Variables and Data Types  
Variables store data like strings, integers, floats, booleans, and lists. Variables can be updated throughout the program.  
**Flag found:** `THM{VARIABL3S}`



## Task 5: Logical and Boolean Operators  
Logical operators (`==`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`) and boolean operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) are used for making decisions and combining conditions.



## Task 6: Shipping Project (If Statements)  
If statements let the program decide what to do based on conditions. Indentation and colons are important syntax components.  
**Flags found:**  
- `THM{IF_STATEMENT_SHOPPING}`  
- `THM{MY_FIRST_APP}`



## Task 7: Loops  
Loops allow repeating actions using `while` and `for` loops. `while` loops run while a condition is true, `for` loops iterate over lists or ranges.  
**Flag found:** `THM{L00PS_WHILE_FOR}`


## Task 8: Bitcoin Project (Functions)  
Functions let me reuse blocks of code with inputs and outputs. I wrote a function to calculate Bitcoin value in USD and alert if it drops below a threshold.  
**Flag found:** `THM{BITC0IN_INVESTOR}`



## Task 9: Files  
I learned how to read from and write to files in Python. Reading files allows importing data; writing files helps store output.  
**Flag found:** `THM{F1LE_R3AD}`



## Task 10: Imports and Libraries  
Python libraries provide ready-to-use functions. I learned how to import libraries like `datetime` and understood how to install additional libraries using `pip`.



## What I Understand From These Python Tasks

Through these tasks, I gained a solid foundation in Python programming, especially tailored for practical and security-related applications.

- **Basic Syntax and Output:**  
  I learned to output text with `print()` and the role of comments.

- **Operators and Expressions:**  
  Using mathematical and comparison operators to perform calculations and evaluate conditions.

- **Variables and Data Types:**  
  Variables store different types of data and can be updated as needed.

- **Logical and Boolean Operators:**  
  Combining conditions with `and`, `or`, and `not` for complex decision making.

- **Conditional Statements:**  
  Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` to run different code blocks based on conditions.

- **Loops:**  
  Automating repetitive tasks with `while` and `for` loops.

- **Functions:**  
  Writing reusable code blocks that accept inputs and return results.

- **File Handling:**  
  Reading from and writing to files to handle data input/output.

- **Imports and Libraries:**  
  Leveraging Pythonâ€™s libraries and installing new ones to add powerful features.


Overall, these tasks have equipped me to write meaningful Python scripts that can automate, make decisions, process data, and be extended with external libraries â€” essential skills for programming in cybersecurity and beyond.

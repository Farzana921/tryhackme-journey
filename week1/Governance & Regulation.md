ðŸ”— Room Link: [Red Team Engagements](https://tryhackme.com/room/redteamengagements)

This room explores the fundamentals of information security governance, regulation, and compliance, with a strong focus on real-world frameworks, standards, and best practices.

## Key Topics Covered

## 1. Importance of Governance & Regulation
- Helps protect against cyber threats through structured policies, procedures, and risk management.
- Ensures adherence to legal, regulatory, and industry standards.

## 2. Information Security Frameworks
- **Policies** â€“ High-level objectives and principles.
- **Standards** â€“ Specific technical or procedural requirements.
- **Procedures** â€“ Step-by-step instructions for tasks.
- **Guidelines** â€“ Recommended but non-mandatory practices.
- **Baselines** â€“ Minimum required security settings.

## 3. GRC Framework (Governance, Risk, and Compliance)
- **Governance:** Sets direction, assigns roles, and ensures oversight.
- **Risk Management:** Identifies and mitigates threats.
- **Compliance:** Ensures legal and industry-standard adherence.
- Real-world example: Financial sector applying GRC for fraud prevention, regulatory compliance, and data protection.

## 4. Key Regulations & Standards
- **GDPR (EU):** Strict data protection law, up to 4% global revenue fines.
- **PCI DSS:** Cardholder data security standard for payment processing.
- **HIPAA, GLBA, PIPEDA:** Protect sensitive data in healthcare, finance, and other sectors.

## 5. NIST Frameworks
- **NIST 800-53:** A set of 20 security control families protecting systems against physical, administrative, and technical threats.
- **NIST 800-63B:** Guidelines for digital identity authentication using passwords, biometrics, and multi-factor techniques.

## 6. ISO/IEC 27001 â€“ ISMS
- International standard for creating and maintaining an Information Security Management System (ISMS).
- Core components: Scope, Information Security Policy, Risk Assessment, Risk Treatment, Statement of Applicability, Audits, and Management Reviews.

## 7. SOC 2 Compliance
- Developed by AICPA to ensure secure handling of customer data by service providers.
- Based on 5 Trust Service Principles:
  - Security
  - Availability
  - Processing Integrity
  - Confidentiality
  - Privacy
- Involves independent auditing and reporting for assurance.


## Final Thoughts

Security is not about achieving 100% protection â€” itâ€™s about reducing risks, being compliant, and staying proactive. Frameworks like ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, and SOC 2 help organisations build strong, adaptable security programs.

## Web Fundamentals & Security Basics â€“ Learning Summary

ðŸ”— Room Link: [Red Team Engagements](https://tryhackme.com/room/howwebsiteswork)


This summary covers the key concepts and skills I learned while working through a beginner-friendly web and security training room, focusing on how websites work, front-end languages, and basic security vulnerabilities.

Task 1: How Websites Work
Websites consist of a Front End (client-side) and a Back End (server-side).

The browser sends requests to a web server, which responds with data used to render the page.

The Front End is what the user sees and interacts with; the Back End handles logic, databases, and responses.

Task 2: HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines the structure of a webpage.

Key HTML elements:

<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares HTML5.

<html>, <head>, <body>: Main structural tags.

<h1>, <p>, <img>, <button>: Content-specific tags.

HTML elements can have:

class (reusable styling),

id (unique identifier),

src (image source), etc.

You can inspect and view HTML on any site via "View Page Source".

Task 3: JavaScript
JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to webpages.

Example use: changing text when a button is clicked.

JS can be embedded inline or via external files using <script> tags.

Events like onclick allow user actions to trigger code.

Example:

js
Copy
Edit
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hack the Planet";
Task 4: Sensitive Data Exposure
Websites sometimes expose sensitive data in their source code.

Example vulnerabilities:

Hardcoded passwords in HTML comments.

Hidden admin links.

Always review the page source code when assessing security.

Found password example: testpasswd.

Task 5: HTML Injection
HTML Injection occurs when user input is not sanitized and is directly rendered into the page.

Malicious users can inject HTML or JavaScript to change the pageâ€™s structure or behavior.

This is a client-side vulnerability.

Prevent it by sanitizing all user input before rendering.

Example exploit:

html
Copy
Edit
<a href="http://hacker.com">Click me</a>
 What I Gained from These Tasks
Solid understanding of the core technologies that power the web: HTML, CSS, JS.

Awareness of how web requests and responses work.

Learned to identify and exploit basic security issues like:

Sensitive data exposure

HTML injection

Gained hands-on experience in web debugging and inspection tools.

Strengthened understanding of safe coding practices like input sanitization.
